# AutoDeploy Trellix Agent
Installing Trellix Agent from Active Directory. This procedure is necessary when using Trellix ePO SaaS, where there is no way to provision the Trellix Agent to new PCs newly added to the domain.

Get download link: The first part will consist of setting up a TrellxSmartAgent download link in ePO SaaS:

1. Create a group in ePO where the machines that will be automatically deployed with the Trellix Agent will be located.
2. Click on the Deployment tab.
3. Select the products that will be installed after the agent is deployed.
4. Copy the agent download URL.
